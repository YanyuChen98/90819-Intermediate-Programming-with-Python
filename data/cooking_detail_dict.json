Most beans will rehydrate to triple their dry size, so be sure to start with a large enough pot. * Preferred Hot Soak and Quick Soak Methods -- Hot soaking helps dissolve some of the gas-causing substances, making the beans easier to digest. For each pound beans, add 10 cups hot water; heat to boiling and let boil 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and set aside for at least one hour (Quick Soak), or up to 4 hours (Hot Soak). * Traditional Overnight Soak -- For each pound (2 cups) dry-packaged beans, add 10 cups cold water and let soak overnight, or at least 8 hours. COOKING DRY OR DRY-PACKAGED BEANS: * Drain soaking water and rinse beans; cook in fresh water. In general, beans take 30 minutes to 2 hours to cook depending on variety. Check bean packaging for specific cooking times and instructions. * Spice up beans while they cook. Seasonings such as garlic, onion, oregano, parsley or thyme can be added to the pot while beans are cooking. Add acidic ingredients, such as tomatoes, vinegar, wine or citrus juices, only at end of cooking, when the beans are tender. * Add salt only after beans are cooked to tender. If added before, salt may cause bean skins to become impermeable, halting the tenderizing process. * To test for doneness, bite-taste a few beans. They should be tender, but not overcooked. When cooling, keep beans in cooking liquid to prevent them from drying out."}, "Basic Mango Preparation": {"ingredients": ["1/2 fresh mango"], "directions": "1) \"SLICE AND SCOOP\" MANGO CUTTING METHOD: Stand the mango on your cutting board stem end down and hold. Place your knife about 1/4\" from the widest center line and cut down through the mango. Flip the mango around and repeat this cut on the other side. The resulting ovals of mango flesh are known as the \"cheeks\". What's left in the middle is mostly the mango seed. Cut parallel slices into the mango flesh, being careful not to cut through the skin. Scoop the mango slices out of the mango skin using a large spoon. 2) \"INSIDE OUT\" MANGO CUTTING METHOD: Stand the mango on your cutting board stem end down and hold. Place your knife about 1/4\" from the widest center line and cut down through the mango. Flip the mango around and repeat this cut on the other side. The resulting ovals of mango flesh are known as the \"cheeks\". What's left in the middle is mostly the mango seed. Cut parallel slices into the mango flesh, being careful not to cut through the skin. Turn the mango cheek 1/4 rotation and cut another set of parallel slices to make a checkerboard pattern. Turn the scored mango cheek inside out by pushing the skin up from underneath. Scrape the mango chunks off of the skin, using a knife or a spoon. Hint: If you are making a recipe that calls for diced mango, make both directions of parallel slices in step 2 closer together. In step 4, slice the mango flesh away from the skin in several shallow layers, rather than scraping down to the skin in one step. The result is small pieces of diced mango and no need to further cut up the mango pieces on your cutting board. 3) USING A MANGO SPLITTER: Stand the mango on your cutting board stem end down and hold. Center the Mango Splitter above the mango, with the opening in the splitter aligned with the widest part of the mango. Firmly push down to separate the mango flesh from the seed. Use the \"Slice and Scoop\" or the \"Inside Out\" methods shown above to separate the mango flesh from the skin in cubes, dices or slices."}, "Basic Rice Preparation": {"ingredients": ["0.17 cup uncooked plain rice (average, all types, but not instant)", "0.29 cup water"], "directions": "COOKING METHODS: * Stockpot Method: Heat all ingredients to boiling; stir.
